I need to make a script that will recursively test and save all of the device pickles

This needs to also increment the test size from 10% to 95% and rename save directories accordingly

I can leave this running overnight and whatever.

From the data I collect from this, I will be able to conclude my research over the past 6 months

**check 450d7066ea25a4c08953187bc4d2c31d4c4922a0.pickle for chargePredict 10% sample results

need to fix issues with days that don't have enough data
fixed this issue by saving just the deviceID - no data
so for every faulty day, there will still be a result pickle, but no useful data inside

9/26 10:00pm-12:30am

In Multithreading - if saving - need to add a check to the save path and not overwrite any
previously tested devices (this will save loads of time)
**this check will only be necessary if testing a directory
***can add an option to override this if we want a clean test

9/29 8:00am-11:00am
10/1 9:00am-11:00am
10/7 8:45pm-11:45pm

**rather than transferring the result pickles back and forth, 
add a text file of all of the completed pickles 
-- in the saveResults function, add appending the filename to a file named chargePredict10.txt or something
